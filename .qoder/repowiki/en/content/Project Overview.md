I --> J[Combine transcripts]
G --> J
J --> K[Role Assignment]
K --> L[Formatted Dialogue]
L --> M[Storage in processed_texts]
M --> N[Ready for Analysis]
```

The pipeline begins with audio ingestion from Telegram, supporting voice messages, audio files, and document uploads. Files are temporarily stored and processed using OpenAI's Whisper model through the VSEGPT API.

A key feature is the handling of large files (up to 2GB) by splitting them into 24MB chunks that fit within API limits, then combining the resulting transcripts. This allows analysis of lengthy interview or audit recordings.

After transcription, the system applies role assignment to distinguish between participants in the conversation. This uses a specialized prompt (assign_roles.txt) to identify and label speaker roles, typically "Employee" and "Client" in hospitality contexts.

The processed text is stored in memory (processed_texts dictionary) associated with the user's chat ID, making it available for subsequent analysis steps. The pipeline includes error handling for common issues like API failures, file corruption, or transcription errors.

```

### Step 1: Audio Input and Authentication

The pipeline begins when a user sends an audio file or voice message to the Telegram bot. The system first verifies user authentication by checking if the user's chat ID is in the authorized_users set. Unauthorized users are prompted to enter a password (default: 1243).

### Step 2: Audio Transcription

Once authenticated, the system downloads the audio file and processes it using OpenAI's Whisper model via the VSEGPT API. The transcription function handles large files by splitting them into 24MB chunks, transcribing each chunk separately, and combining the results.

### Step 3: Role Assignment

The raw transcript is processed to identify and label speaker roles. This step uses a specialized prompt (assign_roles.txt) to distinguish between participants, typically labeling them as "Employee" and "Client" in hospitality contexts. This structured dialogue provides better context for subsequent analysis.

### Step 4: Analysis Selection

The user is presented with a choice between "Interview" and "Design" analysis modes, each leading to different sets of report options. This selection determines the analytical framework applied to the content.

### Step 5: Prompt Selection and Context Preparation

Based on the analysis type and business category, the system selects the appropriate prompt template from the prompts directory. For category-specific analyses (hotel, restaurant, health center), the system automatically detects the business type from the transcript content.

### Step 6: RAG-Enhanced Analysis

The prepared text and selected prompt are processed through the RAG system, which retrieves relevant contextual information to augment the analysis. This step enhances the LLM's understanding with domain-specific knowledge.

### Step 7: LLM Analysis and Report Generation

The augmented prompt is sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet via the VSEGPT API for analysis. The LLM generates a comprehensive report based on the specified analytical framework, following the structure defined in the prompt.

### Step 8: Response Delivery

The generated report is sent back to the user through Telegram. Large reports are split into 4096-character chunks to comply with Telegram's message size limits, ensuring complete delivery of the analysis.

Throughout this pipeline, the system provides visual feedback using a spinner animation during processing stages, improving user experience by indicating that the system is actively working.
