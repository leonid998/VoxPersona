# Migration Guide: Webhook to GitHub Actions

## 📋 Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating VoxPersona from webhook-based deployment to the new intelligent GitHub Actions deployment system.

## 🎯 Migration Benefits

### Current Webhook System
```
GitHub Push → Webhook URL → Python webhook server → deploy.sh → Server
```

### New GitHub Actions System  
```
GitHub Push → GitHub Actions → SSH Connection → Intelligent Logic → Server
```

### Advantages of GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Enhanced Security**: No exposed webhook endpoints
- ✅ **Better Observability**: Complete deployment logs in GitHub
- ✅ **Intelligent Deployment**: Automatic detection of deployment type
- ✅ **Native Integration**: Built into GitHub ecosystem
- ✅ **Manual Control**: Ability to trigger specific deployment types
- ✅ **Rollback Support**: Automatic rollback on failures
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: Faster deployments with smart logic

## 📊 Deployment Logic Comparison

| Change Type | Webhook Behavior | GitHub Actions Behavior | Time Improvement |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Documentation | Full restart (2-3min) | No restart (5-10s) | **95% faster** |
| Python Code | Full restart (2-3min) | App only (30-60s) | **70% faster** |
| Infrastructure | Full restart (2-3min) | Full restart (2-3min) | Same |

## 🔧 Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Backup Current System
```bash
# Backup current deployment files
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  cd /home/voxpersona_user
  tar -czf webhook_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz webhook_server_final.py deploy.sh
  echo 'Current system backed up'
"
```

### 2. Document Current Configuration
- [ ] Current webhook URL and port (8080)
- [ ] SSH key locations and permissions
- [ ] Environment variables and secrets
- [ ] Current deployment process documentation

### 3. Verify Prerequisites
- [ ] GitHub repository access
- [ ] SSH access to server (172.237.73.207)
- [ ] Required permissions for GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Test branch created and functional

## 🔐 Security Migration

### SSH Key Configuration

#### Current Setup Analysis
```bash
# Check current SSH configuration
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  ls -la ~/.ssh/
  cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | grep -c 'ssh-'
"
```

#### GitHub Actions SSH Setup
```bash
# Generate new SSH key for GitHub Actions (if needed)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions@voxpersona" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions_key

# Add public key to server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key.pub root@172.237.73.207

# Test new key
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key root@172.237.73.207 "echo 'GitHub Actions SSH test successful'"
```

#### Configure GitHub Secrets
1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these secrets:
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Content of `~/.ssh/github_actions_key`
   - `SERVER_IP`: `172.237.73.207`
   - `SERVER_USER`: `root`

## 📋 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Actions (Test Branch)

```bash
# Switch to test branch
git checkout test-github-actions-deploy

# Verify workflow file exists
ls -la .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Test commit for validation
echo "Migration test $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Migration test: GitHub Actions deployment"
git push origin test-github-actions-deploy
```

**Expected Result**: GitHub Actions should trigger and deploy successfully

### Step 2: Test All Deployment Types

#### Test NO_RESTART (Documentation)
```bash
echo "Test documentation change" >> SETUP.md
git add SETUP.md
git commit -m "Test: NO_RESTART deployment"
git push origin test-github-actions-deploy
```

#### Test APP_ONLY (Application Code)  
```bash
echo "# Test comment $(date)" >> src/config.py
git add src/config.py
git commit -m "Test: APP_ONLY deployment"
git push origin test-github-actions-deploy
```

#### Test FULL_RESTART (Infrastructure)
```bash
echo "# Test infrastructure change" >> docker-compose.yml
git add docker-compose.yml
git commit -m "Test: FULL_RESTART deployment"
git push origin test-github-actions-deploy
```

### Step 3: Performance Validation

Monitor GitHub Actions execution times and compare with targets:

| Deployment Type | Target Time | Actual Time | Status |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| NO_RESTART | < 15 seconds | ___ seconds | [ ] |
| APP_ONLY | < 90 seconds | ___ seconds | [ ] |
| FULL_RESTART | < 180 seconds | ___ seconds | [ ] |

### Step 4: Production Migration

```bash
# Merge test branch to main
git checkout main
git merge test-github-actions-deploy
git push origin main
```

**Monitor**: First production deployment in GitHub Actions

### Step 5: Parallel Operation Period

Run both systems simultaneously for 1 week:
- GitHub Actions handles new deployments
- Webhook system remains active but unused
- Monitor for any issues

## 🗑️ Webhook System Decommission

### Step 1: Stop Webhook Server
```bash
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  # Find webhook process
  ps aux | grep webhook_server_final.py
  
  # Stop the process (replace PID)
  kill -TERM <PID>
  
  # Verify stopped
  ps aux | grep webhook_server_final.py
"
```

### Step 2: Close Network Port
```bash
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  # Check if port 8080 is open
  netstat -tlnp | grep :8080
  
  # Close port in firewall (if using ufw)
  ufw delete allow 8080
  
  # Or for iptables
  iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
"
```

### Step 3: Remove Webhook Files
```bash
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  cd /home/voxpersona_user
  
  # Move to backup directory
  mkdir -p backup/webhook_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d)
  mv webhook_server_final.py deploy.sh backup/webhook_migration_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
  
  # Remove from startup scripts (if applicable)
  # crontab -e  # Remove webhook entries
  # systemctl disable webhook-server  # If using systemd
"
```

### Step 4: Update Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment instructions
- [ ] Archive webhook documentation
- [ ] Update team runbooks
- [ ] Update monitoring configurations

## 📊 Post-Migration Validation

### Week 1 Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] All deployments use GitHub Actions
- [ ] No webhook server running
- [ ] Port 8080 closed
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] No deployment failures
- [ ] Team comfortable with new process

### Metrics to Track
```bash
# Deployment frequency
git log --since="1 week ago" --oneline | wc -l

# Average deployment time (from GitHub Actions logs)
# Success rate (from GitHub Actions history)
# Developer satisfaction (team survey)
```

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 100% of deployments use GitHub Actions
- [ ] 0 webhook-related security concerns
- [ ] Performance improvements documented
- [ ] Team adoption complete
- [ ] No production issues

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues with GitHub Actions deployment:

### Emergency Rollback to Webhook
```bash
# Restore webhook server
ssh root@172.237.73.207 "
  cd /home/voxpersona_user
  cp backup/webhook_migration_*/webhook_server_final.py .
  cp backup/webhook_migration_*/deploy.sh .
  
  # Restart webhook server
  python3 webhook_server_final.py &
  
  # Reopen port
  ufw allow 8080
"

# Disable GitHub Actions temporarily
# Rename .github/workflows/deploy.yml to .github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled
```

### Rollback Triggers
- Multiple consecutive deployment failures
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Critical security issues discovered
- Team productivity impact

## 📞 Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### GitHub Actions Fails to Connect
```bash
# Check SSH key configuration
ssh -i ~/.ssh/github_actions_key root@172.237.73.207

# Verify GitHub Secrets
# Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
```

#### Deployment Takes Too Long
- Check server resources: `htop`, `df -h`, `docker system df`
- Review GitHub Actions logs for bottlenecks
- Consider Docker image optimization

#### Container Startup Failures
- Check Docker daemon: `systemctl status docker`
- Review container logs: `docker-compose logs --tail=50`
- Verify .env file configuration
